## Impact of this project

The forest fires come at a huge financial and ecological cost. With the prediction of the worldwide forest fires, this disaster can either be prevented or reponded in a timely manner. As a result, we wish our model or statistical findings could help governments and communities sustainably manage the fires. And then improving the biodiversity and reducing the negative impacts of economic development.
