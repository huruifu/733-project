## Questions to be answered

* What factors are most likely to cause forest fires?

* Which regions are most likely to have forest fires in each month? 

* How to predict the fire size class given the geographic information and daily climate records?

## Impact of this project

The forest fires come at a huge financial and ecological cost. With the prediction of the worldwide forest fires, this disaster can either be prevented or reponded in a timely manner. As a result, we wish our model or statistical findings could help governments and communities sustainably manage the fires. And then improving the biodiversity and reducing the negative impacts of economic development.
